        <h2>My Internship Experience at IOV</h2>
<small></small>
<p><a href="https://iov.one/">IOV</a> provides a universal protocol for blockchains and wallet users.</p>

<p>IOV solves the problem of complexity, human error and lack of  interoperability when exchanging digital assets on the blockchain.</p>

<p>IOV provides the Blockchain Communication Protocol that enables  autonomous blockchains to be accessed efficiently. Additionally, IOV  provides the Blockchain Name Service, the first DNS for all  participating blockchains.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-starname">What is a starname?</h3>

<p>A starname is your universal username for the blockchain world.</p>

<p>It enables you to receive crypto-currencies or to log in to blockchain applications in a seamless way. Transferring value becomes fast and easy.</p>

<p>I am so proud to anounce that I am offered a part time internship here as software engineer Intern.</p>

<h2 id="week-1-10-august---14-august">Week 1 (10 August - 14 August)</h2>

<p>I was introduced with the team i.e. <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/antoine-herzog-65aa7257">Antoine</a> the co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davepuchyr/">Dave</a> the CTO and <a href="https://github.com/iharob">Iharob</a> the core developer. I was warmly welcomed by all, was provided access to the Repositories, joined their channel.</p>

<p>For the first two days Iharob was kind enough to navigate me through the application and gave me a brief intoduction of what they are planning to do in the nearby future.</p>

<p>I was provided with a simple task to convert incoming data from API to structured data. As first, I thought this was a easy task, but then came all sort of sub-tasks like creating types, typecasting data, dividing into methods to avoid duplicate code and variable names. Thanks to Iharob, I managed to complete these tasks.</p>

<p>I was provided with some material by Antoine to help we getting familiar with Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptography. Iâ€™m gonna spend my weekend learning about it.</p>

<h2 id="week-2-17-august---21-august">Week 2 (17 August - 21 August)</h2>

<p>Yet to come.</p>
